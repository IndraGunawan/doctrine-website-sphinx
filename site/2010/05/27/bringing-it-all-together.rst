Bringing it all together
========================

Recently we've been making some pretty serious changes around here.
This blog post aims to overview it all and make sure people are
aware of what is going on!

Website Changes
---------------

A few weeks ago I made some
`updates <http://www.doctrine-project.org/blog/a-few-website-changes>`_
to the Doctrine website. Some said it looked like we took a step
backwards. Well, we kind of did. I had to rip apart the website,
remove old legacy code and reorganize things so that it can be
integrated with the changes we wanted to make next. So I've sort of
had to tear it all apart and put it back together a new way. It's
been a bumpy road but we're starting to get the remaining issues
worked out.

The Switch to git
-----------------

The next big change we wanted to make was to switch to
`github.com <http://www.doctrine-project.org>`_ for our source
control. This has a lot of impact on the project since everything
is built around the source control, including the website. That is
why the previous change was necessary in order to make this move
complete.

Splitting Doctrine 2 Sources
----------------------------

The next step for us was to split the Doctrine 2 sources into
separate repositories on github. So now the source code of the
Common, DBAL, and ORM packages are truly separated.


-  `Common <http://github.com/doctrine/common>`_
-  `DBAL <http://github.com/doctrine/dbal>`_
-  `ORM <http://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2>`_

This means the packages can evolve independently and will be
maintained separately from now on. The website also has dedicated
project pages for the
`DBAL <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/dbal>`_ and
`ORM <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm>`_ with plenty
of documentation.

Bringing it all together
------------------------

The last piece that brings it all together is the new
`Guide for Doctrine Contributors and Collaborators <http://www.doctrine-project.org/contribute>`_.
Now that we've moved to git we had to reinvent a lot of stuff we
had already learned for SVN. Thanks to our git mentor David
Abdemoulaie (`hobodave <http://www.twitter.com/hobodave>`_) we have
figured out a workable solution for dealing with the project
dependencies via git submodules that does most of what we want.
Through this process we all worked on some new documentation that
detailed how contributors and collaborators for the Doctrine
Project should work. We really hope that this will help get people
involved with the project and mature things more.
