Doctrine 2 at ConFoo 2010
=========================

This past week I was lucky enough to get to travel to Montreal for
the annual ConFoo conference, previously known as PHP Quebec. I
presented on the latest and greatest version of Doctrine, 2.0 for
the PHP Trac. You can find the slides on SlideShare.com
`here <http://www.slideshare.net/jwage/doctrine-2-enterprise-persistence-layer-for-php-3402070>`_
