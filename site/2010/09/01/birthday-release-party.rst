Birthday Release Party
======================

Today is Jonathan's birthday and in order to celebrate properly
we're rolling out three new releases.

Doctrine Common RC1
-------------------

The first release candidate of the Doctrine Common project.


-  `Installation <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/common/2.0/download/2.0.0RC1>`_
-  `Changelog <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DCOM/fixforversion/10081>`_

Doctrine DBAL BETA4
-------------------

The last beta release of the Doctrine DBAL project.


-  `Installation <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/dbal/2.0/download/2.0.0BETA4>`_
-  `Changelog <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DBAL/fixforversion/10071>`_

Doctrine ORM BETA4
------------------

The last beta release of the Doctrine ORM project.


-  `Installation <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm/2.0/download/2.0.0BETA4>`_
-  `Changelog <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC/fixforversion/10072>`_

Again we want to thank everyone who participated in the ongoing
development efforts, whether it was through bug reports, comments,
critique, praise and/or actual code contributions.

What next
---------

Some might know that we originally planned to release 2.0 stable
today but we're simply not there yet. However, things are going
quite well and we're confident that the final releases of the 2.0
versions are close. The ORM and DBAL now enter a final phase of
bug-fixing to resolve any issues we find critical for the final
releases and will then follow the Common project into RC (release
candidate) status.
