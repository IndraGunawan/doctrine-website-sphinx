Database-Driver Support in Doctrine 2
=====================================

Not only the ORM part of Doctrine will see major changes for the
step from the 1.x to the Doctrine 2 series. The DBAL layer has
undergone major refactorings and there has been a very throughout
separation of concerns. Any database platform that will be
supported has to extend four different classes/interfaces.


-  Doctrine and Doctrine - Both interfaces implement the
   interference between PHP and the Database, they are the lowest
   layer of any platform support.
-  Doctrine - This abstract class requires you to specify the
   specialites of the SQL dialect of the database-platform you are
   going to implement.
-  Doctrine - This abstract class defines the interaction of the
   database platform to create a database schema, for example in
   combination with the ORM SchemaTool.

For the Doctrine 2.0 release we plan to support 4 different
platforms, all tested in-depth:


-  MySQL using the PDO Mysql extension
-  PgSQL using the PDO PostgresSQL extension
-  Oracle using the OCI extension
-  Sqlite using the PDO SQLite extension

Both the SchemaManager and Platform can be re-used for any Driver
that is connected to the database. If you would want to use Mysqli
instead of PDO MySQL you would only need to implement a new Driver
and Statement. And if you just want to change some of the sql
specific details in regard to schema generation you would only need
to extend the AbstractPlatform.

Still, from a database-platform point of view the default support
is lacking, for example MsSql support with both PDO and SqlSrv is
currently missing. Firebird or IBM Db2 are other platforms that are
wide-spread and not supported currently. However we don't want to
rush only half-finished support into Doctrine 2. That is where you
come in: We would greatly appreciate any help in getting support
for any new database platform into Doctrine 2.

For the implementation of a completly new database platform you can
rely on the powerful PHPUnit Testsuite of Doctrine 2. There are
lots of tests that check the functionality of your driver, platform
and schema implementations against various scenarios. Additionally
the complete ORM functional test-suite can run against your new
database platform. Furthermore you can count of everyone in the
Doctrine DEV Team for help, we are hanging around on Freenode IRC
in the #doctrine-dev Channel. You could also create a ticket on
Jira and attach a patch or just discuss your ideas.
