Working with Large Collections in Doctrine2
===========================================

If you access a collection of Entity A pointing to Entity B,
Doctrine2 always initializes the complete collection for you. For
small collections up to around 100 entities this won't be a
problem, however as soon as collections get (much) bigger than this
you can get into serious trouble.

By default Doctrine2 can only optimize adding new entities to a
collection for you. This operation does not initialize the
collection. This will only get you bigger collections though,
reading them is still a pain.

We already got requests from several development teams for better
functionality in this regard and we are planning to add a solution
to this problem that is not constraining your domain model with
technical blurp. However this solution is currently on our schedule
for the 2.1 release of Doctrine only.

Until then I wrote a very little extension for Doctrine2 that
allows you to work with large collections. It has two methods that
compute the following data for any given ``PersistentCollection``:


-  Total Number of Elements in the Collection
-  A slice of entities from the collection using a sql limit (or
   alternative)

You can get this extension from the
`DoctrineExtensions Github repository <http://github.com/beberlei/DoctrineExtensions>`_.

Working with a LargeCollection
------------------------------

The ``LargeCollection`` class is a handler to work with large
PersistentCollections. You can instantiate it by passing an
``EntityManager`` instance:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    use DoctrineExtensions\LargeCollections\LargeCollection;
    
    $lc = new LargeCollection($em);

    **NOTE**

    LargeCollection only works with instances of
    ``PersistentCollection``, not with other implementations of the
    ``Doctrine\Common\Collections\Collection`` interface. That means
    that you can only pass collections to it, whose owning entities
    have been persisted before or are retrieved from the
    EntityManager.


You can compute the total number of elements in a given collection
by passing it to the count method:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $size = $lc->count($article->getComments());

You can retrieve a slice of entities from the collection by
calling:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $slice = $lc->getSliceQuery($article->getComments(), $limit = 30);

As you can see this is very simple to use, but also missing some
bits:


-  In your domain models you sometimes don't want to return the
   ``Collections`` instance but call ``toArray()`` to encapsulate the
   Collections API inside the Entity. For this two new methods are
   required to access to the persistent collections from the inside of
   an entity.
-  The ``remove``, ``removeElement``, ``contains`` and
   ``containsKey`` methods could also be added to the large collection
   handler, making direct calls to the underlying UnitOfWork API.
-  A method that returns an ``IterableResult`` for any given
   collection. This would allow to iterate the complete collection on
   a row-by-row basis, which would eliminate possible max memory
   problems compared to the complete hydration of a collection.
-  Methods link()/unlink() like described in
   `DDC-128 <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC-128>`_

I hope I got your attention and maybe someone has an interest in
extending the LargeCollection a little bit more.
