Doctrine DBAL 2.5 Release
=========================

We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine DBAL 2.5.0
Stable. This release is a landmark in making DBAL more consistent and stable
than it ever was.

DBAL 2.5 will be maintained by a new release-master `Steve MÃ¼ller
<https://github.com/deeky666>`_. Steve has been working
on DBAL for much of his last year and contributed many of the big features that
make up this fantastic release. He will replace Benjamin Eberlei who was the
release master since version 2.0.

You can install DBAL through Composer:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "require": {
            "doctrine/dbal": "2.5.0"
        }
    }

This version is mostly backwards compatible with only some minor breaks, when
using PDO IBM, creating a custom platform or using non-default DateTime
formats. You can see the breaks in the `UPGRADE.md
<https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/master/UPGRADE.md>`_ file.
DBAL 2.5 is also compatible with ORM 2.4, there is no need to wait for ORM 2.5
to be released.

The following list contains the major new features of DBAL:

- Support for SAP Sybase SQL Anywhere versions 10, 11, 12 and 16 (DBAL-475)
- Support for auto-commit=NO on all drivers and platforms. (DBAL-81)
- Refactor exceptions to use common error-codes and exception classes that
  derive from ``Doctrine\DBAL\DBALException``. (DBAL-407)
- Add support to retry connections with ``Doctrine\DBAL\Connection#ping()``
  method. (DBAL-275)
- Add INSERT support to QueryBuilder (DBAL-320)
- Add Binary type for VARBINARY support (DBAL-714)
- Add charset and SSL connection support to PostgreSQL (DBAL-567, DBAL-702)
- Add options support for Myqli (DBAL-643)
- Add support for using database uris with the ``url`` parameter in
  ``DriverManager::getConnection()`` which supports several forms used by PaaS
  providers out of the box (DBAL-1050).
- Improved SQL Server LIMIT emulation support.
