Doctrine Inflector release 1.1.0
================================

We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine Inflector
`1.1.0 <https://github.com/doctrine/inflector/releases/tag/v1.1.0>`_.

This release adds a feature that allows to upper-case words separated by
a custom delimiter (`#11 <https://github.com/doctrine/inflector/pull/11>`_).

We discovered that heroes, buffalo and tomatoes have something in
common (`#18 <https://github.com/doctrine/inflector/pull/18>`_).

"criteria" and "criterion" plural and singular form were reversed: now
fixed (`#19 <https://github.com/doctrine/inflector/pull/19>`_).

Additional inflections were introduced for more irregular forms
(`#20 <https://github.com/doctrine/inflector/pull/20>`_
`#22 <https://github.com/doctrine/inflector/pull/22>`_
`#24 <https://github.com/doctrine/inflector/pull/24>`_).

Last but not least, we now explicitly support and test against PHP 7
(`#21 <https://github.com/doctrine/inflector/pull/21>`_).
