Doctrine ORM 2.5.3 Released
===========================

We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine ORM
`2.5.3 <https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/releases/tag/v2.5.3>`_.

Dependency constraints on the
`doctrine/common <https://github.com/doctrine/common>`_ component supported
versions were corrected, allowing users to install ``doctrine/common``
version ``2.6.*`` together with the ORM.
This also means that PHP 7 scalar type-hints and return type declarations are
now reflected in the generated proxy classes. `#4884 <https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/issues/4884>`_

Merging versioned entities caused the merged instance to have a ``null`` version:
this is now fixed. `#1573 <https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/issues/1573>`_

It was impossible to use interface names when referencing entity types in DQL: it
is now possible to do so when using
the `ResolveTargetEntityListener <https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/blob/v2.5.3/lib/Doctrine/ORM/Tools/ResolveTargetEntityListener.php>`_. `#1573 <https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/issues/1573>`_

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can install the ORM component using Composer:

.. code-block:: shell

  composer require doctrine/orm:~2.5.3

Please report any issues you may have with the update on the
`issue tracker <https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/issues>`_.
