Doctrine Instantiator 1.0.0 released
====================================

We released `Doctrine Instantiator 1.0.0`_ several weeks ago.

This project has been migrated from `ocramius/instantiator`_ into the doctrine organization to
have better maintenance, support as well as handling of security related issues, which is a
priority for us.

The migration has been done because all doctrine ORM and ODM projects were affected by a
quite big `backwards-incompatible change in PHP 5.4.29 and PHP 5.5.13`_, which
`was partially solved in PHP 5.6.0-RC3`_. The main tracking bug for this problem is `DDC-3120`_.

`Doctrine Instantiator`_ provides a simple API to build objects without directly relying on
the `serialization hack`_ that has been explicitly used by all of our data mappers for quite
some time.
