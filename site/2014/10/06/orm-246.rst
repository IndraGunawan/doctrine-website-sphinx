ORM 2.4.4 released
==================

We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine ORM 2.4.4.

We fixed a PHP 5.6 compatibility issue which prevented usage of entities extending from internal
PHP classes or implementing the ``Serializable`` interface
with the ORM: `DDC-3120 <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC-3120>`_.

You can find all the changes on JIRA:

- `ORM 2.4.6 <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC/fixforversion/10723>`_ - 2 issues fixed

You can install the ORM using Composer and the following ``composer.json``
contents:

.. code-block:: json

  {
      "require": {
          "doctrine/orm": "2.4.6"
      }
  }

Please report any issues you may have with the update on the mailing list or on
`Jira <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira>`_.
