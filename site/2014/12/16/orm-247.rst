ORM 2.4.7 released
==================

We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine ORM 2.4.7.

The release includes a fix for ``null`` values in column mapping options
support: `DDC-3425 <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC-3425>`_
We also fixed various ``Paginator`` tool issues:
 - allowing DQL queries that have ``HIDDEN`` selected fields appearing both in the
   ``SELECT`` and the ``ORDER BY``
   clauses: `DDC-3434 <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC-3434>`_
 - allowing DQL queries that have ``SELECT`` clauses containing parameters:
   `DDC-3336 <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC-3336>`_

You can find all the changes on JIRA:

- `ORM 2.4.7 <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC/fixforversion/10724>`_ - 2 issues fixed

You can install the ORM using Composer and the following ``composer.json``
contents:

.. code-block:: json

  {
      "require": {
          "doctrine/orm": "2.4.7"
      }
  }

Please report any issues you may have with the update on the mailing list or on
`Jira <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira>`_.
