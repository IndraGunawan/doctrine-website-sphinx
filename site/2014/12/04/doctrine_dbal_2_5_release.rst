Doctrine DBAL 2.5 Release
=========================

We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine DBAL 2.5.0
Stable. This release is a landmark in making DBAL more consistent and stable
than it ever was.

Starting with 2.5 DBAL will have a new release-master, `Steve MÃ¼ller
<https://github.com/deeky666>`_. Steve has been working
on DBAL for the last two years and contributed many of the big features that
make up this fantastic release. He will replace Benjamin Eberlei who was the
release master since version 2.0.

You can install DBAL through Composer:

.. code-block:: shell
    composer require doctrine/dbal:~2.5

This version is mostly backwards compatible with only some minor breaks, when
using PDO IBM, creating a custom platform or using non-default DateTime
formats. You can see the breaks in the `UPGRADE.md
<https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/master/UPGRADE.md>`_ file.
DBAL 2.5 is also compatible with ORM 2.4, there is no need to wait for ORM 2.5
to be released.

The following list contains the major new features of DBAL:

- Support for SAP Sybase SQL Anywhere versions 10, 11, 12 and 16 (DBAL-475)
- Support for auto-commit=NO on all drivers and platforms. (DBAL-81)
- Refactor exceptions to use common error-codes and exception classes that
  derive from ``Doctrine\DBAL\DBALException``. (DBAL-407)
- Add support to retry connections with ``Doctrine\DBAL\Connection#ping()``
  method. (DBAL-275)
