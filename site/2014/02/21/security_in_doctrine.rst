Security in Doctrine
====================

When using Doctrine in a project it is always a security critical component
because it talks directly to your database. As such security is very important
to us. In security however, context is important and providing you with query
capabilities we have to expose you to the risk of SQL injections.

Doctrine cannot prevent you from building SQL injections into your applications
and so can no other DBAL, because it would require hiding SQL completely. But hiding
SQL completly is not wanted, because it is such a powerful language.

Therefore it is still your responsibility to make sure that you are using
Doctrine correctly when working with SQL.

But how would you know how to do so? Until now we had some small bits about
security here and there in the documentation, mostly in the chapters about
Query objects. We came to the conclusion that this is not enough.

That conclusion sinked in with a security issue we became aware of last month,
where one Doctrine user reported that one of the core
``Doctrine\DBAL\Connection`` APIs is supposedly vulnerable to SQL injection.
When you use ``$connection->insert($tableName, $values)``, then both the table
name and the keys (columns) of the ``$values`` array are not escaped, because
we assume they are never user input.

We evaluated this issue together with `Padraic Brady
<http://blog.astrumfutura.com/>`_ (a known PHP security researcher) and came to
the conclusion that this is not a security issue for us. Why? Because we don't
think this part of the API can be secured and trying will make our users feel
safe, when they are not. Using the DBAL APIs directly always posed a much
higher risk than using just the ORM.

You might think we are nuts by just claiming a non issue, but consider
the assumptions we make about tables and columns and our reasoning:

1. Quoting identifiers is bad, because it changes them from case-insensitive to
   case-sensitive. Even more weird, Oracle unquoted identifiers are uppercased,
   PostgreSQL unquoted identifires are lowercased. MySQL casing is based on a
   config option. Doctrine 1.* had various unfixable bugs because of identifier
   quoting, which is why we decided that Doctrine will not use automatic
   identifier quoting.

2. The APIs of ``Connection#insert()``, ``Connection#update()`` and
   ``Connection#delete()`` therfore accept both quoted and unquoted table/column
   identifiers, because quoting is the users choice.

3. A mechanism to detect SQL injection in strings that can be either quoted
   or unquoted is impossible to write completly secure. There are too many
   edge cases to consider and there is a realistic chance to miss one of them.

4. If you provide an API that is just secure in 99.999% of all cases, then
   you should not claim it is secure at all.

At this point you can still think we are wrong releasing insecure software,
however let me ask back: Isn't PHP shipping insecure software by providing PDO?
SQL injection is possible by using PDO wrong. I can enumerate lots of libraries
where security is the developers responsibility: Template engines,
authentication libraries and so on.

A proper secured system requires knowledge about the context. That is why any
kind of database abstraction layers can never fully protect you from SQL
injection, because it does not know the context you are using it in.

To avoid  secret knowledge about our security assumptions we are now starting
to be completly explicit about these issues. Both DBAL and ORM now contain a
`SECURITY.md` file, which contains basic information about security and links
to much more detailed documentation chapters on Doctrine security.

We have made an effort to list all the functions and operations that are save
from SQL injection. There are not very many of them in the DBAL, because it is
such a low level library. The ORM however is pretty secure, except when
concatenating user input into DQL and SQL queries.
