Doctrine DBAL 2.5 BETA3
=======================

We have released the BETA3 of DBAL 2.5 after some more work on the many new
features. For early testers, we have refactored the Exception support again and
removed the constants in favour of a nicely designed Exception hierachy.  Many
other issues were fixed and we hope this will be the last beta release before a
release candidate in early March and a final release in March as well.

For details about all the new features in DBAL 2.5, see the `previous release
blog post <http://www.doctrine-project.org/2014/01/01/dbal-242-252beta1.html>`_
and the `Jira Release
<http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DBAL/fixforversion/10523>`_.

You can install the BETA through Composer with the following version
constraint:::

    {
        "require": {
            "doctrine/dbal": "2.5.0@beta"
        }
    }

DBAL 2.5 is backwards compatible to 2.4 and earlier in everything except small
details (See UPGRADE.md). You can even test Doctrine DBAL 2.5 with a stable
DBAL 2.4 version.

If you find any problems with this beta, please report a bug `on Jira
<http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira>`_.
