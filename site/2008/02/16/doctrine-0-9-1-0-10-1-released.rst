Doctrine 0.9.1 / 0.10.1 Released
================================

Today the Doctrine team is proud to announce the release of
Doctrine 0.9.1 and 0.10.1. Both releases bring many fixes and a few
minor additions for missing features in each of the branches. The
next release of 0.10.2 will replace the 0.9 branch and all users
will be recommended to upgrade as the 0.9 branch will no longer be
supported and maintained by the core dev team. We except that
0.10.2 is due in two to three weeks. Please upgrade your existing
projects from 0.9 to 0.10 and let us know what issues you come
across when switching so we can ensure a smooth migration from 0.9
to 0.10 for all of our users.

On a side note, many new changes have been made to the website. A
few visual things and a few functional things. You will now find on
the Download page you can now get Doctrine in either zip or tgz
format. We also have our very own PEAR server so you are able to
install Doctrine via the pear command line interface. Our channel
is located at pear.phpdoctrine.org and can be discovered by running
'pear channel-discover pear.phpdoctrine.org'
