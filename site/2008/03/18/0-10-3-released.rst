0.10.3 Released
===============

A few days late, but the 0.10.3 release has been packaged and
released. This release contains nearly 40 closed tickets, and is a
huge step towards bringing the 1st generation of Doctrine to a
stable release. We have already begun development on the 0.10.4
release, and have a few dozen tickets associated to it already. If
you have a ticket associated to the 0.10.4 milestone or any other
release then it is likely their is not a failing test case for it,
as the 0.10 branch now only has 1 failing test case. Make our job
easier and provide a failing test case for your issues. Thanks.
