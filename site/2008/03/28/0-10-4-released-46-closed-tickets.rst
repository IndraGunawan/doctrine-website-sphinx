0.10.4 Released - 46 Closed Tickets
===================================

Today we would like to announce the 0.10.4 release. This release
addresses 46 tickets and is a major step in stabilizing the 1st
generation of Doctrine for the 1.0 release. We will continue with
bug fix only releases until we feel the 0.10 branch is ready for a
1.0 title. Give it a try and give us some tickets and failing test
cases to fix :)

You can checkout the change log for the 0.10.4 release as well as
previous releases here.
