Using Doctrine with Zend Framework
==================================

Today, "rubenv" pinged me in IRC and told me he has put together an
article on how to get started using Doctrine with the Zend
Framework. The article is very simple and does not get in to the
detailed usage of Doctrine, but it shows you how you to integrate
the two frameworks together and even shows a very simple web
application. The article can be found here.
