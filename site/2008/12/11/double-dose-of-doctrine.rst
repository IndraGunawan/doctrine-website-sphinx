Double Dose of Doctrine
=======================

Today I am happy to introduce two new versions of Doctrine! We have
made available yet another maintenance release for the 1.0 version,
`1.0.5 <http://www.doctrine-project.org/download>`_. This release
contains dozens of fixes that are logged
`here <http://www.doctrine-project.org/change_log/1_0_5>`_. In
addition to the monthly 1.0.x maintenance release, we have made
available the
`first beta of the 1.1 <http://www.doctrine-project.org/download>`_
development branch of Doctrine.

This is exciting news because this means we are very close to
releasing a stable version. We just need to work out the last final
kinks and we need your help to do it. You can read about what has
changed in the
`upgrade to 1.1 file <http://svn.doctrine-project.org/branches/1.1/UPGRADE_TO_1_1>`_.
