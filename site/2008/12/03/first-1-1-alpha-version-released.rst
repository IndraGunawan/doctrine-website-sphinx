First 1.1 Alpha Version Released
================================

Today I am very happy to introduce the first alpha version of the
1.1 branch of Doctrine. This means we have just about finalized the
scope of features and are preparing to enter the beta and release
candidate cycles before releasing the stable version.

This new version is sporting dozens of enhancements and even more
bug fixes. Primarily the
`new scalar hydration type <http://www.doctrine-project.org/blog/new-hydration-modes-for-doctrine-1-1>`_ ,
`the migration diff tool <http://www.doctrine-project.org/blog/new-to-migrations-in-1-1>`_ ,
and other
`miscellaneous new features <http://www.doctrine-project.org/blog/doctrine-1-1-development-begins>`_.

You can download the package
`here <http://www.doctrine-project.org/download>`_ and read some
documentation on the changes and new features
`here <http://trac.doctrine-project.org/browser/branches/1.1/UPGRADE_TO_1_1>`_.
