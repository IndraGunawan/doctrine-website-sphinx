A few updates for 2008
======================

Some of these announcements are a little late but I think they
deserve a proper announcement.

First, we have setup a way for you to give us all your money :)
Please feel free to give a little. The purpose of the Doctrine
donation collection is simple. The creators of Doctrine don't work
on this great product for any money. The contributions are made out
of the pure enjoyment of working on a great open source project
such as Doctrine. It is not totally clear what *exactly* the
donations will be used for now, but in the future they may be used
to fund infrastructure expenses required by the project, sending
developers to conferences, marketing, or even split amongst the
developers of Doctrine. So if you or your company uses Doctrine and
are happy with it, a donation to further the project would be much
appreciated.

Secondly, we have made some updates to the website. Specifically
the Download page. It now has proper links to packages and svn for
each release of Doctrine. These packages are generated nightly from
the source in svn.

Finally, as some of you all may already know, we have finally
gotten our release/package management under control and you can
expect stability in the area of releases, branches and BC breaks!
