Road to Doctrine 1.0
====================

First I would like to thank everyone who has adopted Doctrine and
stuck with us through the many long and difficult development
iterations. Though we have many more, and potentially even more
difficult iterations to get through for Doctrine 2.0, we now see
the end of the tunnel for Doctrine 1.0. I have laid out the
official roadmap for 1.0 and it can be viewed on trac here. The
planned release date of Doctrine 1.0 is September 1st 2008, which
is also my 23rd birthday, and Doctrine 2.0 will follow it exactly
one year later on September 1st 2009.
