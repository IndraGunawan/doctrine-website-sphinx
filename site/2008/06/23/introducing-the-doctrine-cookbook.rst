Introducing the Doctrine Cookbook
=================================


.. raw:: html

   <p>
   
Today I would like to introduce something new to the Doctrine
documentation, the Cookbook. This differs from the manual in that
it will contain real world examples and tutorials of how you can
use Doctrine on a daily basis whereas the manual is more of a
technical breakdown of the features in Doctrine. We will be
publishing many additions to the cookbook in the coming weeks. To
start off we have published the following tutorials:
