The Bleeding Edge: Website Upgraded
===================================

This weekend I decided it was time to completely dive in to the
awesomeness that is `symfony <http://www.symfony-project.com>`_
1.2. I upgraded the Doctrine website to 1.2 as well as Doctrine
1.1. I had several schema changes that I migrated to production
with the new
`Migrations features <http://www.doctrine-project.org/blog/new-to-migrations-in-1-1>`_
that were mentioned previously on the blog. It made the upgrade of
the website much easier. The primary motivation for diving in to
this was a blog post made on
`10/18/2008 <http://www.symfony-project.org/blog/2008/10/18/spice-up-your-forms-with-some-nice-widgets-and-validators>`_
and
`10/14/2008 <http://www.symfony-project.org/blog/2008/10/14/new-in-symfony-1-2-make-your-choice>`_
where Fabien talks about forms in symfony 1.2.

Below is an overview of some of the changes made.


-  Upgraded to symfony 1.2
-  Upgraded to Doctrine 1.1
-  New backend control panel for administering the content of the
   website
-  Single Sign-On(SSO) - We now have partial SSO. Trac and the main
   website authentication are shared now. The forum will be integrated
   soon.
-  New groundwork started for several new website features, new
   documentation, user contributed documentation, user contributed
   packages! and more.

Here are some screen shots of the backend magic that was generated
by symfony. I didn't have to do much and in one evening we have a
new content management system backend for the website.

Doctrine Releases
-----------------

The style and custom icons in this list of the available Doctrine
releases were added thanks to my custom theme built specifically
for the Doctrine backend.

Edit User SVN Access
--------------------

Thanks to the symfony form framework I was able to easily add a
custom widget for editing the website users svn access for all the
different Doctrine versions.
