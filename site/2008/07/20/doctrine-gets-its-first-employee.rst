================================

Starting in September 2008, I will begin working full-time on
Doctrine! This great opportunity has been allowed by Sensio, the
creators of the symfony MVC Framework. This arrangement will allow
many great new things to happen for Doctrine. Below you will find a
list of some of the things you can look forward to:

   </li></ul>  <p>
   
This is also good news for the symfony project as it is due to
officially support Doctrine as its primary ORM in future versions.
I will also be helping the core symfony team with the official
integration of Doctrine with sfDoctrinePlugin.
