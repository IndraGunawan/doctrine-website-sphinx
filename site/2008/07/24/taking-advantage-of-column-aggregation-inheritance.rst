Taking Advantage of Column Aggregation Inheritance
==================================================

Today I have published another tutorial in the 1.0 Cookbook. This
recipe solves the same situation where you want to allow address
properties on multiple records. This approach is a much more
normalized implementation compared to using templates/behaviors and
it allows for multiple addresses instead of only one. Check it out
in the cookbook here. Enjoy!
