   <p>
   
Today I am extremely happy to introduce the first stable version of
Doctrine, 1.0.0. If you've been around for a while, then you know
this is a long time coming. We've been hard at work on Doctrine for
nearly 3 years and it is finally time to release a version we will
support with bug fix releases every month. This 1.0 release will be
maintained until March 1st 2010. Now we have 1.0, what is next?
Below are some highlights of what to expect in the future of
Doctrine.

Doctrine 2.0 - We've been working in trunk on Doctrine 2.0 for
quite sometime now and this is the next really big milestone for
the project. As we work on 2.0 we will backport things for
intermediate major versions(1.1, 1.2, etc.)

The Doctrine Company? - We'll be working on a new side to the
Doctrine project for organizing commercial support contracts,
trainings, seminars, certifications, training material and much
more.

Doctrine supported by symfony 1.2 - We will be contributing to the
integration process of Doctrine with sfDoctrinePlugin. 1.2 will be
the first symfony release to bundle Doctrine and support it.
