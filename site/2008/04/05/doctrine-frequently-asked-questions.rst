Doctrine frequently asked questions
===================================

We have compiled a new addition to the Doctrine website, Frequently
Asked Questions. The purpose of this is to help the users of
Doctrine identify any common questions/problems when using
Doctrine. I have added all the questions I have encountered
multiple times over the last year+. If you have any recommendations
for this least please don't be shy and let us know. Thanks.
