New Documentation PDF Downloads
===============================

Today we have some great news! Thanks to Fabien from the
`symfony project <http://www.symfony-project.org>`_ , we now have a
new way to generate the PDF version of our documentation. The new
PDFs are a MAJOR step up from the previous style of PDF and am very
pleased with it! Check it out by viewing the 1.0 version of
`The Guide to Doctrine for PHP <http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/1_0/en/pdf>`_
or
`The Doctrine Cookbook <http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/cookbook/1_0/en/pdf>`_.

What is next?
-------------


-  API Documentation available as PDF.
-  Downloadable package/zip file containing PDF versions of all
   documentation.
-  User submitted articles, snippets, tutorials, etc. to complement
   the official documentation.
-  ...Printed book.

Printed Book
------------

Here is a teaser of the first draft of the front cover for the
printed version of the book. Big thanks goes out to Jason O'Brien
from centre{source} for doing the design work. The printed copy
will be available on lulu very soon we just need to do some more
proof reading and Q&A on everything before it is ready. The printed
version of the book will use a slightly modified version of the PDF
that is available for download on the web.
