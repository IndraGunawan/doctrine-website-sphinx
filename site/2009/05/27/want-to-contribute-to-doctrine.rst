Want to contribute to Doctrine?
===============================

Looking for Developers
----------------------

We've been on the hunt for more Doctrine contributors. As the
number of users of Doctrine grew we expected the number of
commiters to rise with it but this has not been the case. We do get
a lot of small patches here and there, but we are hoping for some
of them to grow in to full-time core developers that are involved
with all the decisions made about Doctrine.

Call to the community
---------------------

You can see Roman made a call to the Doctrine developers mailing
list
`here <http://groups.google.com/group/doctrine-dev/browse_thread/thread/c6e4c74e1a392909>`_
about the issue. We are taking all the feedback in to consideration
and we have started by creating a
`contribute <http://www.doctrine-project.org/contribute>`_ page
that is linked from the primary menu of the website. We hope that
this will help with new users finding information faster about how
they can get started contributing.

Other Ideas
-----------

If you have any additional ideas about how we can promote
contributing to Doctrine you can discuss them in the comments or on
the
`mailing list thread <http://groups.google.com/group/doctrine-dev/browse_thread/thread/c6e4c74e1a392909>`_.
