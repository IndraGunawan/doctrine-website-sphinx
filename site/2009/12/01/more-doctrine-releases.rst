More Doctrine Releases
======================

Only a few hours ago we released the stable version of Doctrine
1.2! Now we bring you two maintenance releases for the 1.0 and 1.1
versions of Doctrine. The number of changes in these releases are
small, but they are important bug fixes. It is recommended that you
upgrade. Download
`1.0.14 <http://www.doctrine-project.org/download#1_0>`_ and
`1.1.6 <http://www.doctrine-project.org/download#1_1>`_ now and
report any issues you discover in
`Jira <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira>`_.
