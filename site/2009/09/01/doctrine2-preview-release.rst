Doctrine 2 Preview Release
==========================

Exactly one year ago today we released Doctrine 1.0 stable, which
was on the birthday of Jon. Again, today we have chosen the
birthday of Jon to release the first preview of Doctrine 2. This is
an alpha release that is not intended for production use.

Doctrine 2 marks the beginning of a new approach to ORM with
Doctrine. It represents a rewrite of more than 90% of the existing
codebase. The new key concepts behind Doctrine 2 are to put your
domain model more into focus and to provide transparent persistence
where the persistence is a service and not an inherent property of
domain classes. This has a lot of advantages like decoupling your
valuable business logic from the persistence layer and easy
testability of your domain model.

Packages
--------

Doctrine 2 is reorganized into reusable layers that are available
as separate packages. The Doctrine 2 Core consists of the following
packages:


-  Doctrine Common (Generic components, high re usability)
-  Doctrine DBAL (The database abstraction layer, includes: Common)
-  Doctrine ORM (The ORM tools, includes: Common + DBAL)

All of these packages are currently distributed and maintained
synchronously which means they are released together and share the
same version numbers. This may change in the future. These three
packages are available as separate downloads even though you will
most likely want to download the ORM package which already contains
the Common and DBAL packages.

Features
--------

This Preview Release is mainly about the core ORM functionality and
features of Doctrine 2, like mapping drivers, DQL, association
mapping, inheritance mapping, change tracking, etc. Most of the
supporting tools that you are used to for rapid development like
the CLI, migrations, behaviors and validation have not yet been
ported to Doctrine 2 and are still under heavy development, most of
them will end up as loosely coupled extensions.

Mapping drivers
---------------

A mapping driver is a particular strategy for providing ORM
metadata to Doctrine 2. This Preview Release contains mapping
drivers for docblock annotations, XML and YAML. The XML and YAML
drivers are still in an experimental stage and while we encourage
you to use them, you may encounter more issues than with the
docblock annotation driver as it is the primary driver used in our
development.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation for Doctrine 2 can be found
`here <http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/2_0/en>`_.
Please be aware that the documentation is still a work in progress
and not all areas have been completed.

Sandbox
-------

To get started quickly, please check out our
`sandbox quickstart tutorial <http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/2_0/en/introduction#sandbox-quickstart>`_.
You can also obtain Doctrine 2.0.0 ALPHA1 via a PEAR package like
normal which can be found on the
`download <http://www.doctrine-project.org/download>`_

We want to encourage everyone to start experimenting with the new
generation of Doctrine in order to get familiar with it and to help
find any outstanding issues.

As always, please report any issues and feature requests through
`trac <http://trac.doctrine-project.org>`_.

Thank you for using Doctrine.
