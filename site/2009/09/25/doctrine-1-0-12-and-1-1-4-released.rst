Doctrine 1.0.12 and 1.1.4 Released
==================================

Today I am happy to bring you two new maintenance releases for the
1.0 and 1.1 versions of Doctrine. These are both standard
maintenance releases and only contain bug fixes.

    **NOTE** **1.1 End of Life**

    This is the second to last maintenance release for the 1.1 version
    and we are still scheduled to hit the end of life on
    **November 1, 2009**. The good news is 1.2 will be a
    **LTS(long term support)** release and will have **18** months of
    support from the date it is released.


You can view the change logs and download these releases on the
`download <http://www.doctrine-project.org>`_ page.
