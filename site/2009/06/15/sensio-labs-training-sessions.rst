Sensio Labs Training Sessions
=============================

If you're a PHP developer and would like to get familiar with the
concepts behind MVC Frameworks and ORMs then you should attend one
of the Sensio Labs hosted training sessions taught by one of our
expert consultants.

The course covers many topics such as:


-  Refactoring a flat file PHP application in to a MVC framework
-  Templating
-  Working environment
-  Routing and HTTP protocol
-  Object Relational Mapper
-  Using the session
-  Unit and Functional Testing
-  Caching your data

The training utilizes the Symfony MVC framework and the Doctrine
Object Relational Mapper as the tools of choice for the workshop.
