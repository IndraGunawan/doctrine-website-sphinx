Doctrine Statistics
===================

On October 18th of 2007 I implemented Google Analytics which
allowed me to track the statistics of the website. On that first
day of statistics gathered we had 93 visitors and yesterday we had
a little over 1500! Needless to say that is pretty exciting!

Here is a graph from google analytics that illustrates the growth.

Here are some more statistics gathered:

Google Analytics
----------------

\| Statistics \| \| \| ----- \| ------ \| \| Visits \| 607,035 \|
\| Absolute Unique Visitors \| 232,366 \| \| Pageviews \| 2,331,993
\| \| Average Pageviews \| 3.84 \| \| Time on Site \| 00:05:02 \|
\| Bounce Rate \| 42.31% \| \| New Visits \| 38.19% \|

Downloads
---------

\| Version \| # \| \| ---------- \| ---\| \| 0.9 \| 126 \| \| 0.10
\| 7521 \| \| 0.11 \| 6691 \| \| 1.0 \| 20300 \| \| 1.1 \| 9539 \|

    **NOTE**
    **These statistics don't count downloads through other sources such as symfony, Doctrine SVN, etc. They only track the downloads through the Doctrine website on the `Download <http://www.doctrine-project.org/download>`_ page.**


Hopefully I can make this same post a year from now about the same
thing and Doctrine will have grown with many new versions.
