Doctrine 2 Documentation
========================

Did you know that Doctrine 2 is already very well documented? I've
noticed recently that some people seem to think we don't have any
documentation for it, and that upgrading will not be possible for
many months to come.

We have an almost complete manual on Doctrine 2 which is the same
concept of "Guide to Doctrine for PHP" for Doctrine 1. It covers
all the core concepts of Doctrine 2 as well as information on how
to get started, code examples, best practices, etc.

The Guide to Doctrine for PHP starts off with the following
chapters...


-  `Introduction <http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/2_0/en/introduction>`_
-  `Architecture <http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/2_0/en/architecture>`_
-  `Configuration <http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/2_0/en/configuration>`_
-  `Basic Mapping <http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/2_0/en/basic-mapping>`_
-  `...and more <http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/2_0/en>`_

The following chapters have been completed and updated recently...


-  `Events <http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/2_0/en/events>`_
-  `Tools <http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/2_0/en/tools>`_

We also have a cookbook with a few articles already too...


-  `Implementing ArrayAccess for domain objects <http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/cookbook/2_0/en/implementing-arrayaccess-for-domain-objects>`_
-  `Implementing the NOTIFY changetracking policy <http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/cookbook/2_0/en/implementing-the-notify-changetracking-policy>`_

We hope this helps you a little bit with getting started using
Doctrine 2 and that you enjoy it! :)
