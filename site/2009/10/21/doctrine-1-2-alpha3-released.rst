Doctrine 1.2 ALPHA3 Released
============================

Today I am happy to bring you hopefully the last alpha release for
Doctrine 1.2. We decided to have one more alpha due to some
interesting issues and improvements brought to our attention
related to PEAR model/file naming standards, result set caching
improvements and a few other things. You can of course check out
what all is new in Doctrine in the
`upgrade <http://www.doctrine-project.org/upgrade/1_2>`_ file.
Below are some quick links to some of the most recent changes.


-  `PEAR Style Model Loading and Generation <http://www.doctrine-project.org/upgrade/1_2#PEAR%20Style%20Model%20Loading%20and%20Generation>`_
-  `Ordering Relationships <http://www.doctrine-project.org/upgrade/1_2#Ordering%20Relationships>`_
-  `Result Cache Improvements <http://www.doctrine-project.org/upgrade/1_2#Result%20Cache%20Improvements>`_

Go ahead and `download <http://www.doctrine-project.org/download>`_
Doctrine 1.2 ALPHA3 and give it a try. Let us know if you have any
issues by raising a new issue in
`JIRA <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira>`_.
