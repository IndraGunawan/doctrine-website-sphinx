Doctrine 1.2 Nearing Stable Release
===================================

Today I am happy to release to you the second ALPHA release of
Doctrine 1.2. Honestly, we didn't receive many reports of
regressions or problems with the new things in Doctrine 1.2 and we
know lots of people have upgraded and using it so we feel it is a
pretty stable release already.

You can view what all changed in this release by checking the
`changelog <http://www.doctrine-project.org/change_log/1_2_0_ALPHA2>`_
and you can snag it from the
`download <http://www.doctrine-project.org/download>`_ page.

We hope that everything goes fine from here and the next release
will be BETA1 followed by an RC and stable release. Please give 1.2
a try and report any regressions to us so that we can be sure to
get them fixed before the final stable release.
