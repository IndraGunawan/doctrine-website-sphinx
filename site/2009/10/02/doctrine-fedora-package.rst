Doctrine Fedora Package
=======================

Thanks to Christof Damian, a loyal Doctrine user, if you are a
Fedora user you can now yum install the latest stable version of
Doctrine. Below is what you can run from the command line to get
it!

::

    yum install php-doctrine-Doctrine

Enjoy and let us know if you have any issues. Thanks
