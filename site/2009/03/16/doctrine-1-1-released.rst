Doctrine 1.1 Released
=====================

Today I am very pleased to bring news to you that Doctrine 1.1.0
stable is available. This is a significant release for the 1.x code
base. It contains dozens of new features and bug fixes. The 1.1
test suite now has **0** fails in the test suite compared to 1.0
having **12**! We recommend you upgrade your projects.

    **NOTE** Some have asked whether 1.1 has all the same bug fixes
    that are in 1.0. The answer is yes. We are committed to maintaining
    both branches and will continue committing fixes to all branches
    when it applies.


Highlights
~~~~~~~~~~


-  New hydration methods
-  New migration diff tool
-  Better custom accessor/mutator support and integration with
   fromArray() and toArray()
-  Improvements to getModified(), toArray(), fromArray(),
   synchronizeWithArray()
-  Improvements to core behaviors Searchable, SoftDelete,
   Versionable
-  Dozens of small improvements and additions across the api
