Doctrine 1.1 Documentation
==========================

Today I have begun updating the documentation to reflect the
changes made in 1.1 and
`The Guide to Doctrine for PHP <http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/1_1/en>`_
is now available. We still have some more changes to make but most
things have been updated and added.

Below is a list of some of the things that still need some
updating.


-  Migrations
-  SoftDelete
-  Searchable

Please lend a hand to us by reviewing the documentation and helping
us identify things that are lacking or 100% missing. You can create
new tickets in `trac <http://trac.doctrine-project.org>`_ under the
"Documentation/Website" milestone and we'll get them fixed asap.
