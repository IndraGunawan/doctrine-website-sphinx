Doctrine 1.2.0-BETA2 Released
=============================

Today I am happy to bring you the second beta of the latest
Doctrine 1.2 version. This is a solid bug fix release and we're
getting very close to a stable 1.2 version of Doctrine! It is
recommended that you upgrade and
`report <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira>`_ any issues in
`Jira <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira>`_ to help us test for
regressions between 1.1 and 1.2.

Take a look at the
`changelog <http://www.doctrine-project.org/change_log/1_2_0_BETA2>`_
and try it out by `downloading <http://www.doctrine-project.org>`_
it.
