A Doctrine Triple Play
======================

Today I am happy to bring you three new versions of Doctrine:

Doctrine 1.0.13
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a regular maintenance release for the Doctrine 1.0 branch
and contains several bug fixes. Check out the
`change log <http://www.doctrine-project.org/change_log/1_0_13>`_
for the changes contained in this release.

Doctrine 1.1.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a regular maintenance release for the Doctrine 1.1 branch.
This will be the one of the last maintenance release for the
Doctrine 1.1 branch as the scheduled support for this version has
technically ended on November 1st. We will have a few more
maintenance releases for 1.1 since Doctrine 1.2 is not out yet.
We'll give a few months of overlap to give people some time to
upgrade to Doctrine 1.2. Check out the
`change log <http://www.doctrine-project.org/change_log/1_1_5>`_
for the changes contained in this release.

Doctrine 1.2.0-BETA1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the first BETA of the Doctrine 1.2 branch. This release is
a very exciting one as it will be a LTS(long term support) version
and it contains lots of new features and bug fixes. Check out the
`change log <http://www.doctrine-project.org/change_log/1_2_0_BETA1>`_
for the changes contained in this release. You can also see
documentation for everything that has changed or is new in Doctrine
1.2 on the
`What's New <http://www.doctrine-project.org/upgrade/1_2>`_ page.

Like always, you can grab the package for these new versions on the
`download <http://www.doctrine-project.org/download>`_ page.
