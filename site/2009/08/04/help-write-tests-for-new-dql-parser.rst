Help write tests for new DQL Parser
===================================

As you all know, we're focusing most of our development time on
Doctrine 2.0 these days. To help speed things up, we would like to
ask for help writing tests from our users

Recently I finished new
`DQL parser for 2.0 <http://trac.doctrine-project.org/browser/trunk/lib/Doctrine/ORM/Query/Parser.php>`_.
Most of you may not be familiar with compiler's theory, but for
those that are, it's a top-down recursive descent parser for a
context-free grammar, usually known as LL(k).

We mapped the entire supported DQL into a document, which is an
`EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backusâ€“Naur_Form>`_ ,
which is a meta-syntax notation to express context-free grammars.
This one is quite simple to be readable by humans. Yes, we are
humans if you raise the question! =)

The header of our EBNF describes some terms and conventions, but
here is a small subset of our grammar:

::

    FromClause                        ::= "FROM" IdentificationVariableDeclaration {"," IdentificationVariableDeclaration}*
    IdentificationVariableDeclaration ::= RangeVariableDeclaration [IndexBy] {JoinVariableDeclaration}* 
    RangeVariableDeclaration          ::= AbstractSchemaName ["AS"] AliasIdentificationVariable
    AbstractSchemaName                ::= identifier
    AliasIdentificationVariable       ::= identifier

It's not mentioned in this subset some pieces just for clarity.
Identifier is a terminal (no grammar rule to follow after that) and
is a string (ie. "``name``", "``email``").

What does this subset do?
-------------------------

It processes this pieces of DQL:

::

    FROM User u
    FROM User AS u, u.Group g

How does it do that?
--------------------

Each piece of DQL is converted to a series of tokens. Some tokens
are defined in our
`Symbol Table <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_table>`_ , which
is then validated and correctly typed into the right token type.
For example... when it finds the "``FROM``", it'll return for us
internally a token in an array format of:

::

    array(
        'value' => 'FROM', 
        'type' => Lexer::T_FROM, 
        'position' => 0
    )

Value is the actual string representation in DQL, type is the token
type that was brought by symbol table and position is the position
of this token in the DQL string.

Then token is validated in the DQL parser; if it is expected the
``T_FROM``, just match and go to next token, if not raise a syntax
error. Imagine someone types this: "``FROM User u, u.Group u``". It
is not valid DQL, because alias "``u``" is being used twice. That
is the task of another check, which inspects the requested DQL
defined symbol table and reports for semantical errors. We removed
the lexical errors since we use them as identifiers, so there is no
lexical error checks in DQL. Not that it may open a hole in our
structure, syntax and semantical checks do all that we need.

How can I help?
---------------

We currently have a single test that checks for DQL recognition. We
need to expand it to cover as much situations as possible. If you
follow the EBNF grammar rules, you'll see that for example, IN
condition supports either a series of Literals (which can be
strings, booleans, etc), an InputParameter or a subselect. We need
some people with free time to cover all possible situations; I mean
that we needs something like these queries:

::

    SELECT u FROM CmsUser u WHERE u.id IN (1, 2)
    
    SELECT u FROM CmsUser u WHERE u.id IN (?0)
    
    SELECT u FROM CmsUser u WHERE u.name IN ('guilhermeblanco', 'jwage', 'romanb')
    
    SELECT u FROM CmsUser u WHERE u.id IN (SELECT u2.id FROM CmsUser u2)

By doing (sometimes) stupid queries and complex queries, we cover
all possibilities and then we can finally consider that we have a
good coverage in our DQL support.

If you load the
`LanguageRecognitionTest <http://trac.doctrine-project.org/browser/trunk/tests/Doctrine/Tests/ORM/Query/LanguageRecognitionTest.php>`_ ,
you'll find that we have already builtin 2 methods to help you
asserting DQL support: ``assertValidDql`` and ``assertInvalidDql``.
Just follow the EBNF, pick defined models under
`Models/CMS folder <http://trac.doctrine-project.org/browser/trunk/tests/Doctrine/Tests/Models/CMS>`_
and start writing tests.

Running tests
-------------

It is not hard to execute new test suite. Once you have
`PHPUnit <http://phpunit.de>`_ and `XDebug <http://xdebug.org>`_
installed, go to tests folder of trunk, create the directory
``_coverage`` (CHMOD 0777) and execute:

::

    phpunit --coverage-html=./_coverage Doctrine_Tests_AllTests

Then you'll have coverage too, which means it'll be even better to
see where it's missing tests in suite.

Once you write your tests, create a ticket in our trac and then
upload the patched file there. We'll review your tests and commit
them.

To generate a patch file, just type:
``svn diff > /path/to/path/file.diff`` I hope you enjoy new
structure and contribute with lots of tests!
