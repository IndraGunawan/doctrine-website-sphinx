Doctrine 2.1 Release Candidate 2
================================

RC2 of Doctrine 2.1 is packaged and can be grabbed from
`PEAR <http://pear.doctrine-project.org>`_ and the download
section.

We fixed several inconsistencies, backwards compatibility breaks
and some bugs.

Please test this release as it will probably be the base of the
final release due to be released later this week. The scheduled
date is Thursday 30th, but due to personal timetable this may
become the weekend.
