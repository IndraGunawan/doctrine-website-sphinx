Maintenance Releases 2.0.5 for DBAL and ORM
===========================================

Slightly behind schedule we released the next round of maintenance
versions of Doctrine DBAL (2.0.5) and ORM (2.0.5) today. It also
includes a Security fix for DBAL in combination with PDO MySQL and
charsets that was closed in PHP 5.3.6. If you are using 5.3.6, you
should now use the "charset" option in
DriverManager::getConnection() instead of the MysqlSessionInit
listener.
