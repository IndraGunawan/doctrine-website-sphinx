Doctrine MongoDB ODM BETA2 Released
===================================

After a long wait, I am happy to bring you the second beta release
of the new Doctrine persistence layer for
`MongoDB <http://mongodb.org>`_. This release includes dozens of
bug fixes and improvements and it is recommended that you upgrade
as soon as possible. You can learn about how to get the code here.

About the Release
-----------------

My full-time job is working at OpenSky, where we use the MongoDB
ODM and many of the improvements and work are a result of the
development we've been doing there. The changelog is very large as
the development spanned almost 5 months with commits from over 15
developers all over the world. Here are some of the people who've
contributed this release:

Documentation
-------------

Check out the
`documentation <http://www.doctrine-project.org/docs/mongodb_odm/1.0/en>`_
as it is has been completely updated and improved for this release.
We fully migrated the docs to use reST and Sphinx to generate our
documentation so it is much improved over the previous versions.

Doctrine Project as a Whole
---------------------------

The MongoDB ODM is one of a few new projects under the Doctrine
umbrella. You may also want to take a look at the CouchDB ODM and
the PHP Content Repository ODM. These projects are all very
exciting for the Doctrine Project but more for PHP as a whole. They
are a new generation of libraries built for PHP 5.3 that bring a
higher level of code quality to your PHP projects.

If you encounter any problems, bugs or issues please report them in
Jira. If you have any questions you can try a mailing list or IRC.
