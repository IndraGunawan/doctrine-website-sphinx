Security Fix: Upgrade to 1.2.4 and 2.0.3 immediately
====================================================

Because of a SQL injection possibility we urge users of Doctrine
1.2 and 2 to the newly released versions of both libraries
immediately. Both versions only include the security fix and no
other changes to their previous versions 1.2.3 and 2.0.2.

Affected versions are:


-  1.2.3 and earlier for PostgreSQL and DB2 Dialects
-  2.0.2 and earlier

The security hole was found today and affects the
``Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms\AbstractPlatform::modifyLimitQuery()``
function which does not cast input values for limit and offset to
integer and allows malicious SQL to be executed if these parameters
are passed into Doctrine 2 directly from request variables without
previous cast to integer. Functionality building on top using limit
queries in the ORM such as ``Doctrine\ORM\Query::setFirstResult()``
and ``Doctrine\ORM\Query::setMaxResults()`` are also affected by
this security hole.

You can grab the packages from PEAR, Archive or Github, see the
respective links more details:


-  `ORM <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm/download>`_
-  `DBAL <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/dbal/download>`_

The fix for this security hole breaks backwards compatibility for
developers that extend the
``Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms\AbstractPlatform::modifyLimitQuery()``
method, because it is now marked as final. Please overwrite the
``Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms\AbstractPlatform::doModifyLimitQuery()``
method instead.
