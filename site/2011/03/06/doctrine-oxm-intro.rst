A Doctrine OXM Introduction
===========================

Greetings programmers!

Some of you may have noticed a new project being hosted by
Doctrine's `github <http://github.com/doctrine>`_ named
`Object XML Mapper(OXM) <https://github.com/doctrine/oxm>`_. The
OXM is the newest member of the Doctrine family, and serves as
persistence and marshalling framework for PHP objects to XML, and
back again. I'd like to take a moment to introduce myself, the
company I work for, and the pain points behind the project's
inception.

We at `Opensoft <http://www.opensoftdev.com/>`_ have always been
fans of open source software, and love to give back to the
community. I recently was required to implement some vendor
specific XML within a corporate PHP application. The XML itself had
the following requirements and pain points:


-  900+ page specification... over 600 unique XML elements.
-  The XML is used as a workflow. Lots of pull xml, alter it
   slightly, and save it back
-  The XML must be available to the end user upon request.
-  Some of the XML had to be able to be sent via POST to other
   services, and parse responses back

Working with objects is so much better than working with such
complex XML.

As a PHP enthusiest and fan of Doctrine, I created a small project
that was capable of marshalling, unmarshalling, and persisting PHP
objects to XML using
`Doctrine Common <http://github.com/doctrine/common>`_ package as a
base, and many ideas from the ORM, and ODM projects. The Java
`Castor <http://www.castor.org>`_ project also brought a lot of
ideas to give a high degree of control to the developer during the
(un)marshalling process. ClassMetadata is collected for each
@XmlEntity class and used to perform the mapping from PHP objects
to native XML.

Right now, the API is still quite unstable, but we're working to
change that. Currently Doctrine users should find a lot of
familiarity between OXM and other Doctrine initiatives. We've tried
to stay as close to the Doctrine ways of doing things as possible.
If you feel like this project could help you make working with XML
better, please send me a line, fork the project, and send some pull
requests!

Enjoy!
