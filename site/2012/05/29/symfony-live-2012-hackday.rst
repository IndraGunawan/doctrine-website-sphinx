Symfony Live 2012 Hackday
=========================

Next week will be `Symfony Live 2012 <http://paris2012.live.symfony.com/>`_ in
Paris and the Doctrine DBAL/ORM Team will be represented by Guilherme, Alexander, Marco
and me. Jeremy is also there and knows the MongoDB ODM inside out.

Guilherme and Jeremy will give two talks:

- "Using MongoDB responsibly" Jeremy Mikola 
- "ORMs don't kill your database, developers do!" Guilherme Blanco 

Additionally all of us will participate in the hackday on saturday.

Doctrine 2.3 is around the corner (propably during July) and we still have some
features that we want to finalize and work on together. Feel free to join us if
you want to contribute. We are always looking for interested developers that
help with tickets, support, documentatation or anything else.

During the conference you can find us by looking for the `dark blue Doctrine
t-shirts <http://distilleryimage8.instagram.com/30f1aa1ea9d311e1a92a1231381b6f02_7.jpg>`_.
