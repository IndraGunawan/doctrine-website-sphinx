Doctrine 2.3 Beta
=================

**16.7.2012**

We tagged the Doctrine 2.3 BETA1 release today. This includes tags for the
Common, DBAL and ORM projects.

This release trys to keep backwards compatibility to every previous release as
much as possible, however some slight changes might be necessary to your
applications. See the UPGRADE files of each project for details:

* `ORM <https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/blob/master/UPGRADE.md>`_
* `DBAL <https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/master/UPGRADE>`_

This new release contains not single blockbuster feature, but very many little
ones:

* Custom ID Generators
* Naming Strategies
* Collection Criteria API
* @AssociationOverride and @AttributeOverride (useful for Trait and
  MappedSuperclass)
* Arbitrary JOIN Syntax (FROM User u JOIN Comment c WITH c.user = u.id)
* Named Native Queries

We will flesh out the documentation and information about all new features in
the coming beta phase. We hope to release the final version of Doctrine 2.3
just before the upcoming Symfony 2.1 release.

Please test this release with your applications and provide us with feedback
about issues that you find.

You can install the Beta through `Github <https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2>`_  or `Composer <http://www.packagist.org>`_:
