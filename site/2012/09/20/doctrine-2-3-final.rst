Doctrine 2.3 final relased
==========================

**20.9.2012**

After a 2 month long phase of beta and release candidates we can finally
announce the release of Doctrine 2.3. This includes new versions for the
packages Common, DBAL and ORM.

This release trys to keep backwards compatibility to every previous release as
much as possible, however some slight changes might be necessary to your
applications. See the UPGRADE files of each project for details:

* `ORM <https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/blob/master/UPGRADE.md>`_
* `DBAL <https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/master/UPGRADE>`_

Compared to previous versions there are no new blockbuster feature, but many
little optimizations:

* Custom ID Generators
* Naming Strategies (Camel-, Underscore Cased)
* Collection Criteria API
* @AssociationOverride and @AttributeOverride (useful for Trait and
  MappedSuperclass)
* Arbitrary JOIN Syntax (FROM User u JOIN Comment c WITH c.user = u.id)
* Named Native Queries

The complete changelogs are listed on JIRA:

* `Common Changelog
  <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DCOM/fixforversion/10183>`_
* `DBAL Changelog
  <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DBAL/fixforversion/10184>`_
* `ORM Changelog
  <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC/fixforversion/10185>`_

We will flesh out the documentation and information about all new features in
the coming month. If you want to contribute to the documentation of new
features see the `DBAL <https://github.com/doctrine/dbal-documentation>`_ and
`ORM <https://github.com/doctrine/orm-documentation>`_ documentation links on
Github.

You can install the final release through `Github <https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2>`_

        "require": {
            "doctrine/orm": "2.3.0"
