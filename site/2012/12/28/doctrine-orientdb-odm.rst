Doctrine OrientDB Object Document Mapper
========================================

"2012 is the year of graph databases" was the
sentence that a lot of people were hearing at the
end of 2011, especially after the explosion of
Big Data associated with social networks.

At the beginning of this year, a really promising
GraphDB, `OrientDB <http://orientdb.org>`_ ,
saw its first stable release (1.0.0) which finally 
gave to the world a stable toy pretty different
from the traditional RDBMS that we're used to see
and from the document-based DBs like MongoDB or
CouchDB: OrientDB integrates document capabilities
with a graph layer, thus it sounded very, very
interesting.

Even before going stable, there were some companies
already using OrientDB, thanks to the language-specific
drivers created by the community surrounding this GraphDB:
one of them, for PHP, was `Orient <http://github.com/congow/Orient>`_ ,
a bunch of classes that wrapped PHP's native cURL functions
to make queries against OrientDB's via the HTTP protocol.

Day after day, the guys behind Orient, this PHP library,
decided to add - mostly inspired by the doctrine 1 query
builder and the Doctrine2 ODMs - abstraction and layers over
that bunch of classes, finally having 3 different pieces of
software to interact with OrientDB from PHP: the HTTP binding,
which does HTTP calls to the OrientDB server, the Query Builder,
which provides an object-oriented synthax to write SQL+
(OrientDB's SQL) queries and the Data Mapper, which is still
unfinished.

Trying to adhere to the Doctrine2 ODMs standards, the code looks
pretty similar:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    // invoking a repository
    $userRepository = $manager->getRepository('My\Entity');

    // creating SQL+ queries
    $query = new Query();
    $query->from(array('users'))->where('username = ?', "admin");

    // mapping POPOs
    namespace Domain;

    use Doctrine\ODM\OrientDB\Mapper\Annotations as ODM;

    /**
    * @ODM\Document(class="Address")
    */
    class Address
    {
        /**
         * @ODM\Property(type="string")
         */
        public $street;
    }

    // finding a record
    $record = $manager->find($id);


The work done so far was interesting enough to think about
an OrientDB ODM inside the Doctrine organization, thing that
eventually happened today when the old repository has been
moved to the `doctrine organization <https://github.com/doctrine/orientdb-odm>`_
on Github.

More news are going to come in the next weeks, as the target is to
release a stable version of the OrientDB ODM this year: you can
already `use it <https://packagist.org/packages/doctrine/orientdb-odm>`_
or even `fork it <https://github.com/doctrine/orientdb-odm>`_ if you want
to contribute or propose a patch.

For further informations you can subscribe to the doctrine-dev
google group or join the IRC channel #doctrine-dev on Freenode.
