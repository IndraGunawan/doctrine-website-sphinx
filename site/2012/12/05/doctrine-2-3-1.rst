Doctrine 2.3.1 relased
======================

**05.12.2012**

We have released the first mini release in the 2.3 cycle. Due to high workload
of all the participating developers we couldn't release this earlier. We hope
to release 2.3.2 in a much shorter period from now.

* `DBAL Changelog
  <http://doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DBAL/fixforversion/10325>`_
* `ORM Changelog
  <http://doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC/fixforversion/10323>`_

You can install the release through `Github <https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2>`_ ,
download, PEAR or `Composer <http://www.packagist.org>`_:

        "require": {
            "doctrine/orm": "2.3.1"
        }
    }
