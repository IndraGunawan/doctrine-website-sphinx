New Website
===========

As you all may have noticed, we have put up an actual website. The
manual, api documentation, and trac are now all available from the
same interface/design. However, the design you see now is only
temporary and a new design will be implemented in the near future.
We have also added the ability to comment on manual
chapters/sections, blog posts, and api documentation classes.
