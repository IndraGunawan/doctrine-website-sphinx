Doctrine MongoDB ODM release 1.1.1
==================================

We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine MongoDB ODM
`1.1.1 <https://github.com/doctrine/mongodb-odm/releases/tag/1.1.1>`__.

Bug fixes in this release
-------------------------

Notable fixes may be found in the
`changelog <https://github.com/doctrine/mongodb-odm/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.1.md#111-2016-07-27>`__.
A full list of issues and pull requests included in this release may be found in the
`1.1.1 milestone <https://github.com/doctrine/mongodb-odm/issues?q=milestone%3A1.1.1>`__.

Installation
------------

You can install the latest version using the following ``composer.json`` definitions:

.. code-block:: json

  {
      "require": {
          "doctrine/mongodb-odm": "^1.1.1"
      }
  }

Future Releases
---------------

Work on the much anticipated 2.0 version of MongoDB ODM with support for the new MongoDB driver is
beginning, however we are unable to set a release date yet. Likely this will take some time thus we
decided to schedule a 1.2 version to be released before 2.0. This release will have all features of
2.0 that can be introduced in a backward compatible way as well as more deprecation notices to ease
further migration to 2.0 as much as possible.
