Documentation, Project Manager, Website

Jonathan is a software developer who currently lives in Nashville, TN. He joined the Doctrine project as a contributor in early 2007 and has been involved in one way or another since. Jonathan currently works full-time as a software developer at ShopOpenSky, a social commerce platform that uses the Doctrine MongoDB ODM.

It all began at the age of 12 when he first got his hands on the tools to build his first website. From then on he hopped from one thing to another learning the various aspects of programming in several different languages. He enjoys working on Doctrine as it is a daily challenge and allows him to explore uncharted territories in PHP.
