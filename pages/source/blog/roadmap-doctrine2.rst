=======================
Whats next? Our Roadmap
=======================

Doctrine 2 is now stable for about three weeks and we are pretty
happy about the increase in community discussions on IRC and
mailing list. Additionally its good to see that we are not flooded
with new bug reports and we can keep closing all the incoming
issues very fast.

At this point you are probably interested in our roadmap for minor
and bugfix releases.


-  We will release bugfix releases every other month
-  We target minor releases for every 6 month, leading with a four
   month implementation and then a beta + RC timespan of two month.

To be specific, 2.0.1 is scheduled for next week and 2.1 is
scheduled for June 30th 2011.

You can follow the Tracker with all the features that are planned
for 2.1:

`http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC/fixforversion/10022 <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC/fixforversion/10022>`_

You can already start testing 2.1 development with two new features
as of last week:


-  `Foreign Keys as Primary Keys <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC-117>`_
-  `Extra Lazy Collections <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC-546>`_
