=========================
Doctrine in your language
=========================

I have been waiting for this day for some time, the day we have the
manual in a 2nd language. For many months the website has been
capable of handling multiple languages but the features have not
been exposed until now. Thanks to Masaki and Takeshi, two very
experienced Japanese symfony + Doctrine developers, we now have the
Doctrine manual available in Japenese. The primary text of the
website will also be translated in the following weeks. If you are
interested in having the Doctrine website and manual in your
language, please contact me so we can make arrangements for you to
have access to easily provide translations.
