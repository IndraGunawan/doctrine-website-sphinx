===========================
Doctrine 2.4 Beta2 released
===========================

**11.05.2013**

We have released the second beta version of Doctrine 2.4. Some of
the changes are listed in `this talk
<https://speakerdeck.com/asm89/what-is-new-in-doctrine>`_ by Alexander
and me from Symfony Live Berlin last year.

Most of the new functionality is already documented and marked with "Since
2.4". We will also prepare a blog post for the release that shows all the
new functionality in one place.

You can find a list of changes on `Jira
<http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20in%20(DDC%2C%20DBAL%2C%20DCOM)%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20%222.4%22%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Resolved%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC>`_.

You can install the release with `Composer <http://www.packagist.org>`_:

::

    {
        "require": {
            "doctrine/orm": "2.4.0-beta2",
            "doctrine/dbal": "2.4.0-beta2",
            "doctrine/common": "2.4.0-rc2"
        }
    }

Please test this release with your existing applications to allow us to find BC
breaks and remove them before the final release. This will be the last beta
before Release Candidates will be created. We expect to need only one
RC and that the final release will follow shortly.

You should make yourself familiar with the UPGRADE documents, as we had
to make some backwards compatibility breaks to fix nasty bugs:
