=======================
Major Site Enhancements
=======================

You've probably noticed over the past few days I have rolled out
some major new site enhancements. You can find more information
below about all the changes made.

Register Now!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have opened up a new registration portal on the Doctrine website.
This will create a login both on the website and Trac and is also
connected to your SVN account if you choose to request access.

Login Now!
~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have registered you can login to the
`website <http://www.doctrine-project.org/login>`_ and
`Trac <http://trac.doctrine-project.org/login>`_. This will make
some extra functionality available for you to manage your user
information.

New Extensions Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A place where you can browse, search and find out what extensions
are available for Doctrine. It contains documentation, ability to
run the unit tests and download the code.

Check it out `here <http://www.doctrine-project.org/extensions>`_.

User Documentation Area
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a long time I have wanted to have an area of the website where
users could manage as much user contributed documentation as they
want. I have started the new site with a tutorial on
`how to write an extension <http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/user/1_2/en/how-to-write-an-extension>`_.

New Homepage Look
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have slightly tweaked the homepage design to match the design of
the new Doctrine
`book <http://www.amazon.com/Doctrine-ORM-PHP-Jonathan-Wage/dp/2918390038/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1246303098&sr=8-1>`_.
This is our first book so if you want to support the Doctrine
project or just want to learn about Doctrine then we suggest you
purchase a copy! :)

Manage your User Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Central location where you can manage all the information you
control as a Doctrine authenticated user. You can see what
extensions you've written, control your user contributed
documentation, request SVN access and update your account
information. Check it out
`here <http://www.doctrine-project.org/user/account>`_.

These changes are primarily based around the new extensions
repository which is available for Doctrine 1.2. You can read about
what else is new in Doctrine 1.2
`here <http://www.doctrine-project.org/upgrade/1_2>`_.
