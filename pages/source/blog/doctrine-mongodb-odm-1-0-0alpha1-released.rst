=========================================
Doctrine MongoDB ODM 1.0.0ALPHA1 Released
=========================================

Today I am very happy to announce the release of the first alpha
version of the Doctrine `MongoDB <http://www.mongodb.org>`_ Object
Document Mapper. This is exciting as it is the beginning of a whole
new chapter in the life of the Doctrine Project. We hope to
continue adding packages to allow you to transparently persist your
domain objects to a variety of different database engines!

Features
--------

Below you will find a list of some of the features provided by the
Doctrine MongoDB Object Document Mapper:


-  Transparent persistence.
-  Map one or many
   `embedded <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/mongodb_odm/1.0/docs/reference/embedded-mapping/en>`_
   documents.
-  Map one or many
   `referenced <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/mongodb_odm/1.0/docs/reference/reference-mapping/en>`_
   documents.
-  Create references between documents in different databases.
-  Map documents with
   `Annotations <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/mongodb_odm/1.0/docs/reference/annotations-reference/en>`_,
   `XML <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/mongodb_odm/1.0/docs/reference/xml-mapping/en#xml-mapping>`_,
   `YAML <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/mongodb_odm/1.0/docs/reference/yml-mapping/en#yml-mapping>`_
   or plain old PHP code.
-  Documents can be stored on the
   `MongoGridFS <http://www.php.net/MongoGridFS>`_.
-  Collection per class(concrete) and single collection
   `inheritance <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/mongodb_odm/1.0/docs/reference/inheritance-mapping/en>`_
   supported.
-  Map your Doctrine 2 ORM Entities to the ODM and use mixed data
   stores.
-  Inserts are performed using
   `MongoCollection::batchInsert() <http://us.php.net/manual/en/mongocollection.batchinsert.php>`_
-  Updates are performed using the atomic operators $set, $pullAll,
   $pushAll and $increment instead of saving the entire document.
-  `Migrate <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/mongodb_odm/1.0/docs/reference/migrating-schemas/en>`_
   your schema as your domain model evolves and changes.
-  `Fluent Object Oriented Interface <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/mongodb_odm/1.0/docs/reference/query-api/en>`_
   for building and executing queries.
-  `Map Reduce <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/mongodb_odm/1.0/docs/reference/map-reduce/en>`_
   integration.

You can continue reading the
`Introduction <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/mongodb_odm/1.0/docs/reference/introduction/en>`_
chapter in the reference documentation to get a grasp of what
exactly the Doctrine MongoDB Object Document Mapper does by looking
