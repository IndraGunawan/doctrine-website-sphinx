===========================
Doctrine ORM 2.1.4 released
===========================

I just released Doctrine ORM 2.1.4. The Doctrine ORM 2.1.3 release has a
regression in the EntityManager#merge() method, which is fixed in this release.
See the
`changelog <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC/fixforversion/10165>`_.

Get the package from `PEAR <http://pear.doctrine-project.org>`_,
`Downloads <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects>`_ or from
`Github <https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2>`_.
