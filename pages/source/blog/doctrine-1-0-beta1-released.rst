   <p>
   
Today I am happy to announce the release of Doctrine 1.0-BETA1.
This marks the true start for the 1st generation Doctrine stable
lifecycle. As you may already know, Doctrine 1.0 has been slated to
be released on September 1st 2008 for quite some time now. We still
have a few more pre-1.0 releases to go until 1.0. The roadmap for
now is BETA1, RC1, RC2 and then 1.0 STABLE. You can see the roadmap
in trac if you're interested in keeping up with the Doctrine
schedule. More information on 1.0 and what other things to expect
on September 1st will be given soon. Make some noise!
