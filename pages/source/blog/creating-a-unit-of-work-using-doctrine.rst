======================================
Creating a Unit of Work Using Doctrine
======================================

I am happy to introduce the latest contribution to the 1.0
cookbook, Creating a Unit of Work Using Doctrine by Jon Lebensold.
Big thanks to him, he reached out to me wanting to contribute
something to the project so he offered to add this great recipe to
the cookbook. It properly demonstrates the unit of work pattern for
saving and deleting Doctrine objects. If you are interested in
contributing to Doctrine, adding something to the cookbook is a
great way to help out by only giving 1 hour of your time. Contact
me at jonwage [at] gmail.com if you are interested in
contributing.
