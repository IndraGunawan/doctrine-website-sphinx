=======================
Doctrine Future Roadmap
=======================

So, lately we've been discussing and getting a lot of questions
about the future roadmap of Doctrine, specifically 2.0. If you are
following PHP 5.3 you will have noticed that PHP 5.3 RC4 was
released last week. This means that the stable release of 5.3 is
very near.

Below you will find a schedule of the roadmap we have planned for
the upcoming months/years.

\| Date \| Item \| \| -------------- \|
------------------------------------------------ \| \| 06/22/2009
\| Branch Doctrine 1.2 \| \| 06/24/2009 \| PHP 5.3.0 Stable Release
(YES!!!) \| \| 09/2009 \| Begin 1.2 release cycle. Alpha, Beta, RC,
Stable \| \| 09/2009 \| Final 6 months of 1.0 Support \| \| 09/2009
\| Launch 2.0 Alpha 1 \| \| 11/2009 \| Launch 1.2.0 with Long Term
Support (18 months) \| \| 11/2009 \| Symfony 1.3 + Doctrine 1.2 \|
\| 11/2009 \| End Doctrine 1.1 Support \| \| 03/2010 \| End
Doctrine 1.0 Support \| \| 03/2010 \| Continue 2.0 release cycle \|
\| ??/2010 \| Release 2.0.0 with Long Term Support (18 months) \|
\| 06/2011 \| End Doctrine 1.2 Support \|

We hope that the above timeline gives PHP 5.3 plenty of time to be
adopted before we officially stop support for the Doctrine 1.x
series. We think it will be plenty of time but depending how things
play out, we can always add more time to the support life cycle of
the 1.x series, but we hope to not have to. So, this Wednesday when
PHP 5.3 is released, please switch to it if you can and help with
the adoption.
