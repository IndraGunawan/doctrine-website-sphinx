=========================
Symfony Live 2012 Hackday
=========================

Next week will be `Symfony Live 2012 <http://paris2012.live.symfony.com/>`_ in
Paris and the Doctrine Team will be represented by Guilherme, Alexander, Marco
and me. Guilherme will give his talk on "ORMs don't kill your database,
developers do!" on Friday and we will all participate in the hackday.

Doctrine 2.3 is around the corner (propably during July) and we still have some
features that we want to finalize and work on together. Feel free to join us
if you want to contribute. We are always looking for interested developers
that help with tickets, support, documentatation or anything else.

During the conference you can find us by looking for the [dark blue
Doctrine
t-shirts](http://distilleryimage8.instagram.com/30f1aa1ea9d311e1a92a1231381b6f02_7.jpg).
