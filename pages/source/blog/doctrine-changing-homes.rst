=======================
Doctrine changing homes
=======================

You all may have noticed the stability of the website going up and
down recently. Up until now we have been lucky to have our good
friend Ian Christian(pookey in IRC) host all the Doctrine
infrastructure for over 3 whole years! With Doctrine continuing to
grow and move forward, it is time to move on to greener pastures to
a dedicated home.

Tonight we will try to begin the migration to our new home.
Hopefully this transition will be fairly seamless but we expect at
least a little downtime. We are moving the website, Trac and SVN
all at once to avoid the migration lasting over a long period of
time. Thanks for your patience while we work through these issues.
