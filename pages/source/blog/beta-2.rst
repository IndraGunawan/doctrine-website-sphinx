======
Beta 2
======

The Doctrine team is proud to announce that we have scheduled the
release of the second beta snapshot for November 31st, 2007. This
is very exciting news for the Doctrine team and community.

This means Doctrine is nearing a real release candidate :) As you
all know, we had a RC1 that was released a little while back, but
it was a mistake to call it an RC since we planned on still making
many changes that would break BC. We have corrected ourselves and
renamed it Beta1. We will continue with beta releases until we are
comfortable with releasing a true RC1.
