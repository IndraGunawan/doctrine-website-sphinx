==================================
Doctrine 1.0.10 and 1.1.2 Released
==================================

Today I am happy to release two new maintenance releases for
Doctrine. As usual we have a new version for the 1.0 branch and a
new version for the 1.1 branch. The new versions can be gotten on
the `Download <http://www.doctrine-project.org/download>`_ page.

You can review the changelogs for
`1.0.10 <http://www.doctrine-project.org/change_log/1_0_10>`_ and
`1.1.2 <http://www.doctrine-project.org/change_log/1_1_2>`_ to see
what all issues have been addressed in these releases.

On a side note, development on the Doctrine 1.2 version will begin
very soon so if you have any ideas or features you'd like to see in
this version please bring them to our attention and we may be able
to address them in this version. We plan for the 1.2 version to
concentrate on bug fixes, performance fixes and small features to
make the use of the 1.x version of Doctrine more enjoyable without
any major BC breaks.
