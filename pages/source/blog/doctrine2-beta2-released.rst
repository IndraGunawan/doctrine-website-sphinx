========================
Doctrine2 BETA2 Released
========================

Today we are happy to announce the immediate availability of the
second beta version of Doctrine2. This is the first release after
the
`split <http://www.doctrine-project.org/blog/bringing-it-all-together>`_
of Doctrine2 into three independent projects, Common, DBAL and ORM.
This change took longer than we expected but we are back to our SVN
productivity now and strive to surpass it utilizing Git.

Beta 2 is a completely backwards compatible release and over 60
issues and bugs have been closed in total. The following larger
changes have been introduced from Doctrine2 Beta 1:

   ClassLoader#getClassLoader methods
