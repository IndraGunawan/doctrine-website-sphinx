===============================
symfony Doctrine Schema Manager
===============================

As you all probably know, Doctrine has been tightly integrated with
`a few <http://trac.doctrine-project.org/wiki/integrate>`_
different PHP frameworks. Since symfony was my choice of framework
a few years back, I have dedicated a lot of time towards working on
the integration between the two.

Something I've always thought would be fun to build and has been
one of the most requested items by users is a nice web based
interface for managing your schema and generate your models from
it. With the
`new form framework <http://www.symfony-project.org/blog/2008/10/18/spice-up-your-forms-with-some-nice-widgets-and-validators>`_
as of
`symfony 1.1 <http://www.symfony-project.org/blog/2008/06/30/the-wait-is-over-symfony-1-1-released>`_,
you can build rich forms with a nice OOP interface. This made it
extremely easy to make the schema manager feature of the
`sfDoctrineManagerPlugin <http://www.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfDoctrineManagerPlugin>`_.
It was as simple as automatically generating a set of forms from
the schema information data structure inside of Doctrine.

This symfony plugin allows you to manage all your schema
information from a nice web based interface. You can create new
schemas or load your existing schemas to edit. More information
about it as well as screen shots can be found
`here <http://www.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfDoctrineManagerPlugin>`_.
