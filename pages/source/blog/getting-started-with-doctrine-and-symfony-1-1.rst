=============================================
Getting started with Doctrine and symfony 1.1
=============================================

Today, over on the symfony-project blog. A short tutorial on how to
get started using Doctrine and symfony 1.1 has been published. As
of symfony 1.1, Doctrine is officially supported by symfony and
this is the first step of many to make Doctrine the default ORM in
symfony. Over the coming months, much of the symfony + Propel
documentation will be ported to work with Doctrine. The tutorial
can be read here.
