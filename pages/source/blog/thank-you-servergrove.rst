=====================
Thank you ServerGrove
=====================

As you all may know, we recently
`moved <http://www.doctrine-project.org/blog/doctrine-changing-homes>`_
the Doctrine infrastructure to a brand new home. This is all thanks
to `ServerGrove <http://www.servergrove.net/>`_. I contacted them a
few months ago about potentially sponsoring us and they did not
hesitate one bit. They were more than willing to setup a dedicated
community server for us, free of charge. Within 48 hours of my
e-mail I had a dedicated server ready to go. I had the server for
about a month before I was able to make the move. They simply moved
faster then I expected and have gone above and beyond anything I
could have imagined.

If you all need proper hosting support for your Symfony or Doctrine
projects, I would highly recommend them.
