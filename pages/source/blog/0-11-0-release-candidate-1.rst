==========================
0.11.0 Release Candidate 1
==========================


.. raw:: html

   <p>
   
Today I am happy to announce the first release candidate for the
next major version of Doctrine, 0.11. The 0.11 version of Doctrine
brings over 50 addressed tickets, a few new features, a few
performance improvements and lots of updates to the
documentation/manual.

Here are the highlights:

   </p><p>
   

-  \*Table.php classes are no longer generated by default when
   generating models from an existing database schema. This also means
   that ATTR\_AUTOLOAD\_TABLE\_CLASSES now defaults to FALSE

   -  Fixed some serious hydration bugs.
