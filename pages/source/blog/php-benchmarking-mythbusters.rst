============================
PHP Benchmarking Mythbusters
============================

First of, this blog post sucks. I thought I would never write such
a senseless apples and oranges comparison with artificial and
meaningless benchmarks, but I was just a bit astonished by the
results that I would like to share.

I use object-relational mapping tools in many different languages,
from Java to C# to PHP. One of the many supposedly lightweight
alternatives in PHP to Doctrine is Outlet. After stumbling upon
this comment on a
`stackoverflow.com post <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/185358/simple-php-orm>`_:
**"Gotta second Outlet. Doctrine is comically bloated - it is WAY too big to be a sensible choice for anything but the lightest of server loads."**
I thought I take a look at Outlet. This ORM seems to consist of
only 9 classes! It can't get any more lightweight right? I assumed
it would blow Doctrine out of the water performance-wise in all
situations.

So I downloaded Outlet 0.7 and created a simple test database with
just 1 table. Then I wrote a small script that bootstraps Outlet,
inserts 500 objects into the database and reads them out afterwards
(Yes, it's stupid, just like most other artificial benchmarks).

Environment is PHP 5.3.0 with APC.

    ini_set('error_reporting', E_ALL);
    
    class Bug
    {

            'Title'     => array('Title', 'varchar'),
            'Description' => array('Description', 'varchar')
          )
        )
      )
    );
    Outlet::init($config);
    $outlet = Outlet::getInstance();
    $outlet->createProxies();
    
    $s = microtime(true);
    $outlet->getConnection()->beginTransaction();
    for ($i = 0; $i < 500; ++$i) {
        $bug = new Bug;
        $bug->Title = 'This is a test bug';
        $bug->Description = 'Hey there!';
    
        $outlet->save($bug);
    }
    $outlet->getConnection()->commit();
    
    $e = microtime(true);
    echo "\nInsert:" . ($e - $s) . "\n";
    
    $outlet->clearCache();
    
    $s = microtime(true);
    $bugs = $outlet->select('Bug');
    $e = microtime(true);
    
    $outlet->clearCache();
    
    echo "\nQuery:" . ($e - $s) . "\n";
    
    echo "\n" . (memory_get_usage() / 1024) . ' KB ' . PHP_EOL;

    **CAUTION** First off, ini\_set('error\_reporting', E\_ALL); was
    necessary to silence the following E\_STRICT warnings coming from
    Outlet:

    ::

        Strict Standards: Non-static method OutletMapper::get() should not be called statically,
        assuming $this from incompatible context in /Users/robo/dev/php/outlet/outlet-0.7/classes
        /outlet/Outlet.php on line 184
        
        Strict Standards: Only variables should be passed by reference in /Users/robo/dev
        /php/outlet/outlet-0.7/classes/outlet/OutletMapper.php on line 546

    Does not really look good (and does not speak for Outlet very
    well), but anyway.


I did the same for Doctrine 2.0,
*without setting up a metadata or query cache*.

Here are my results.

No, I did not swap the numbers, I promise. You see that the D2
version uses about 400KB more memory but the result of the timings
are quite surprising. Being curious I ran both scripts several
times which means the query section has to hydrate 500 objects more
for each run.

Did you expect these results? After all Doctrine is so bloated,
right? (Doctrine 2 full package ~250 classes) and Outlet is so
lightweight (~9 classes)?

Bottom line:


-  The number of classes barely means anything. (Its probably a
   good criterion if you're short on disk space).
-  "Lightweight" is a buzzword and meaningless without a reference
   point.
-  Don't judge a library by its size and certainly dont try to draw
   conclusions from the size to the performance, or worse to the
   scalability. It just doesnt work.
-  *Artificial benchmarks suck.*
-  To all the folks hunting for everything lightweight and
   micro-benchmarking all day long: You're wasting your time (Just
   like I did with this stupid benchmark...).
-  Don't trust artificial benchmarks (Not even this one).

PS: This is no post against Outlet, so if any Outlet guys or fans
are reading this, please don't feel offended. Since I dont know
Outlet well I'm sure I did a lot of things wrong but thats really
not important here. I am just making a stance against all the
ridiculously stupid artificial benchmarks out there that try to
make people believe Doctrine is slow and bloated. This post shows I
can make it look the other way around easily. That just shows how
meaningless these comparisons are.

    **NOTE** All the code used to run these benchmarks can be
    downloaded from
    `here <http://www.doctrine-project.org/downloads/doctrine2outletbenchmark.zip>`_.
    It is a zip archive containing all the code you need to run the
    benchmarks yourself.
