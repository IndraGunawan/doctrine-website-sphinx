===============
Beta 2 Released
===============

On Friday November 30th, the second beta release of the PHP5
Doctrine ORM software was released. A lot of progress has been made
since the first beta(formerly known as RC1). Dozens and dozens of
tickets have been fixed, new features have been added, much needed
re-factorings have taken place and the community behind Doctrine is
growing daily.
