==================================
Doctrine 1.0.11 and 1.1.3 Released
==================================

Today I am happy to introduce two new maintenance releases for
Doctrine, 1.0.11 and 1.1.3. As always these are regular maintenance
releases and contain dozens of bug fixes. Below you will find links
to view the changelogs for both releases.


-  `Doctrine 1.0.11 Changelog <http://www.doctrine-project.org/change_log/1_0_11>`_
-  `Doctrine 1.1.3 Changelog <http://www.doctrine-project.org/change_log/1_1_3>`_

It is recommended that you upgrade as soon as possible. You can
download the new versions from the
`download <http://www.doctrine-project.org/download>`_ page.
