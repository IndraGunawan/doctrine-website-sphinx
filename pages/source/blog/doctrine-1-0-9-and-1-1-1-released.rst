=================================
Doctrine 1.0.9 and 1.1.1 Released
=================================

Today I am very happy to make available two new releases of
Doctrine for the 1.0 and 1.1 code bases. These are both significant
bug fix releases and it is recommended that you upgrade right
away.


-  `1.1.1 <http://www.doctrine-project.org/download/1_1_1/format/tgz>`_
-  `1.0.9 <http://www.doctrine-project.org/download/1_0_9/format/tgz>`_

You can find more information about these releases as usual on the
`download <http://www.doctrine-project.org/download>`_ page.
