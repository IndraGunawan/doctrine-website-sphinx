==============================
Introducing the Doctrine Forum
==============================

For those of you who are not keen on using the mailing list or irc
for getting help with Doctrine, we now have a public Forum, powered
by PHPBB3(which is very nice btw). Please contact me at jonwage at
gmail.com if you would like a forum for your language added or if
you are interested in being a moderator.
