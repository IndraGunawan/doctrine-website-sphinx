=======================================
Doctrine 1.1 is right around the corner
=======================================

1.1 Release Manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, I would like to introduce **Guilherme Blanco** as the
release manager of **Doctrine 1.1**. This means he will be
responsible for organizing the tickets and managing the releases
for the 1.1 branch from now on. So, if you have any issues you can
yell at him :)

1.1 Release Candidate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another great thing today is that we have made available the first
release candidate of the 1.1 branch. We were originally planning on
having a third beta but as the amount of tickets that came in was
practically none, we decided to move on to the release candidate
stage.

As always, you can
`download here <http://www.doctrine-project.org/download>`_ and
check out the
`change log <http://www.doctrine-project.org/change_log/1_1_0_RC1>`_
and the `upgrade <http://www.doctrine-project.org/upgrade/1_1>`_
document to find out what has changed in 1.1.
