=======================

Due to a minor regression in 1.0.1 we are releasing 1.0.2 which
addresses the issue discovered. The issue was reported and fixed
immediately. Big thanks to Adam Huttler for the detailed report
which allowed us to fix the issue right away. You can download the
new version here or upgrade via pear as usual.
