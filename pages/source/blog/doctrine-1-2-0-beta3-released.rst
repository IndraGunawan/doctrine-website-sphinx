=============================
Doctrine 1.2.0 BETA3 Released
=============================

We're getting very close to a stable Doctrine 1.2 with the latest
BETA3 being released today. This will most likely be the last beta
release before our first release candidate next week. If everything
goes as planned we will have a stable release hopefully a little
before the end of November.

You can view the
`change log <http://www.doctrine-project.org/change_log/1_2_0_BETA3>`_
or `download <http://www.doctrine-project.org/download#1_2>`_ this
release now. If you find any issues please open tickets in
`Jira <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira>`_.
