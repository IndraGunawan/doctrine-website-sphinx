===========
URL Changes
===========

Recently we have done some work to sort out our domain names and
the permanent URL structure we will use from now on. We have put
rules in place to maintain all existing URLs so they redirect to
www.phpdoctrine.org, trac.phpdoctrine.org and svn.phpdoctrine.org.
You will need to update your svn externals to point to
svn.phpdoctrine.org.
