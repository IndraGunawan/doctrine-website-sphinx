=========================
Doctrine 2 BETA1 Released
=========================

Today we are pleased to announce the immediate release of the first
beta version of Doctrine 2. It comes with some delay which was
caused partly by our move to git and github and the switch to the
Symfony Console component for the CLI. We had to confront the alpha
users with quite some backwards compatibility problems and we
apologize for that. Starting with the beta period you can expect
the amount of backwards incompatible changes to be much lower.

Since the ALPHA4 release over 160 issues have been resolved. You
can find the full changelog
`here <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10032&styleName=Html&version=10030>`_.

Some of the most important changes were the shift towards the
Symfony (2) Console component for the CLI as well as the
introduction of the inversedBy attribute for bidirectional
associations, among others. For some help with upgrading from
ALPHA4 to BETA1, please consult
`the upgrade page <http://www.doctrine-project.org/upgrade/2_0>`_.

You can get the new release as usual from our
`download page <http://www.doctrine-project.org/download>`_ or
`directly from github <http://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2>`_.

We would like to thank all the adopters of the early alpha
releases. All your issue reports, feature and enhancement requests
and general feedback and criticism have helped a lot to move the
project forward.

Looking forward, we will likely have at least 2 or 3 beta releases,
about every 1-2 months, before we go RC. Once that happens, the API
is ultimately frozen until the stable release.
