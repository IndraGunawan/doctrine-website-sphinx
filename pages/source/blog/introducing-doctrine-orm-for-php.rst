=================================
Introducing: Doctrine ORM for PHP
=================================

Today I am very happy to announce that we have a first draft
available of the new main Doctrine documentation which is titled,
"`Doctrine ORM for PHP <http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/1_0/en>`_".
The content of this documentation was re-organized and completely
re-written from the "Old Manual". The order of the chapters and
sections have been re-thought and we've tried to put them in a more
logical order. Now you can follow along in the chapters with code
exercises and actually play with Doctrine as you read!

Main Highlights
===============


-  Almost 100% re-written.
-  Chapters renamed and reorganized.
-  Chapters split a part in to multiple to ease reading and flow.
-  Added sample Doctrine implementation for executing exercise code
   as you read.
-  Lots of aesthetic improvements: SQL highlighting, YAML
   highlighting and better PHP highlighting colors.

    **NOTE** We also added a few new markups that get rendered as boxes
    that standout with a representative icon. The three different boxes
    are: note, tip and caution.


To Do
=====

With this announcement we have a few more things left to do and we
need your help!

Perform Week of Revisions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First we need to spend about a week or so proof-reading the the new
documentation. This is where the community can really be helpful.
Go ahead and
`create a trac account <http://trac.doctrine-project.org/register>`_
if you don't already have one. This way when you're reading and you
spot a problem or have an idea how something could be better you
can `create a ticket <http://trac.doctrine-project.org/newticket>`_
easily.

    **NOTE** The goal here is to get the 1.0 version tightened up and
    polished with a nice shine! Then we can branch the new
    documentation for 1.1.


Provide Exercise Code for Download
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the end of each chapter we will provide a tagged copy of the
state of the exercise code so you can check your work against ours
or if you get behind you can get caught back up by downloading the
code.

Release Doctrine 1.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have a few more bugs to fix in the 1.1 version then we will
release the second stable version of Doctrine, 1.1. Right before we
release Doctrine 1.1(which will hopefully also be in a week or so),
we will branch the new documentation for 1.1 and make all the
necessary updates based on
`what's changed <http://www.doctrine-project.org/upgrade/1_0>`_.
Then we will release and open it to your suggestions.

Printed Book: "Doctrine ORM for PHP"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the new documentation has a bit of time to gather some user
feedback and typos weeded out we will offer the documentation in a
physical printed format through `lulu <http://www.lulu.com>`_.
Don't worry we will still offer all the documentation for free on
the website. Even if you've already read the documentation on the
web you can show your appreciation for the project and support it
by purchasing a copy.

    **TIP** If you want to print a rich text version of the Book
    yourself instead of using the PDF or ordering a copy, we have
    implemented a print stylesheet so when you access the documentation
    `here <http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/1_0/en/one-page/print>`_
    you will get the version styled for printing.

Now go ahead and check out
`Doctrine ORM for PHP - Guide to Doctrine for PHP <http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/1_0/en>`_
and bring me some feedback. :)
