=======================================
Doctrine ORM for PHP available in print
=======================================

Last night the
`Doctrine ORM for PHP <http://www.amazon.com/Doctrine-ORM-PHP-Jonathan-Wage/dp/2918390038/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1246303098&sr=8-1>`_
book became available on the Amazon website. This is our first
official piece of published documentation and we are very excited
and proud to see this.

If you are an existing or new Doctrine user, it is much appreciated
if you purchase a copy. Since Doctrine is an open source project we
don't make any money directly from it. Doctrine is all possible
because of the contributors and the companies that fund it, like
`Sensio Labs <http://www.sensiolabs.com>`_. So it is a very nice
gesture, even if you are already a Doctrine expert, to purchase a
copy of the book to show your appreciation and support for the
project.
