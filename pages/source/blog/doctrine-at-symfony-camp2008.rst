===========================
Doctrine at SymfonyCamp2008
===========================

This year I will be making a presentation on Doctrine at the 2008
SymfonyCamp conference on September 12th and 13th. This is a huge
opportunity for the project as we'll get to spread the word about
Doctrine to dozens of symfony developers. Come see me at
SymfonyCamp and register today. Slots are filling up fast and
registration closes soon so sign up now!
