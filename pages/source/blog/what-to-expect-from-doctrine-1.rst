==============================
What to expect from Doctrine 1
==============================

As you all can obviously see, our focus around here these days has
been on Doctrine 2. While overall this is a great thing, we still
have a stable Doctrine 1.2 version to maintain. This blog post will
give you a little information about Doctrine 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.

Doctrine 1.0 and 1.1 End of Life
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may not have noticed, but the end of life for Doctrine 1.0 and
1.1 has come and gone earlier in the year. As of right now we will
not be committing anymore bug fixes to these branches. All
development resources will now focus on finishing Doctrine 2 and
maintaining 1.2.

Doctrine 1.2 Maintenance Releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since Doctrine 1.2 is the last stable version to be released for
the Doctrine 1 series, we decided to open up the development a
little bit for the maintenance releases. Previously we were very
strict with only allowing bug fixes, but we will now allow a little
more flexibility to the types of things we commit to these
releases. They can now contain small enhancements and improvements
as long as they do not break backwards compatibility. Of course
when adding things we cannot always be 100% sure that something is
BC, so we will announce each 1.2.x release one week prior to it's
packaging and deployment in order to give people time to test
things in SVN.

The reasoning behind this move is because we want to still improve
the small usability issues of the Doctrine 1 series without having
to commit to entirely new major versions. This way we are not
leaving the Doctrine 1 code behind while we're focusing on the
Doctrine 2 version. We hope that you all are okay with this move.
If you have any issues please let us know!
