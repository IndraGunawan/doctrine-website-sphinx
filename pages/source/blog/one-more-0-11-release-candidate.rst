===============================
One more 0.11 Release Candidate
===============================

Well, we discovered some bugs in the last RC of 0.11 so we have
decided to have another release candidate to make sure the 0.11
branch is a solid major release of Doctrine. As always the
changelog can be read in the CHANGELOG in svn or on the website.
Hopefully this will really be the last release candidate of 0.11
and we will release a stable version. Once 0.11 is released we plan
to immediately begin working on 0.11.1 bug fix release as well as a
new 0.12 branch which will bring some new features as well as
dozens of bug fixes. Thanks for all the contributions from the core
developers and community for this release.
