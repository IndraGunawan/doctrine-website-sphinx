=====================
Doctrine Lazy Loading
=====================

Did you know?
-------------

Did you know that in Doctrine if you don't specifically select a
property or join a relationship in your DQL query, you can lazily
load that data? Here is a simple example to demonstrate.

::

    [php]
    $q = Doctrine::getTable('User')
      ->createQuery('u')
      ->select('u.id, u.username')
      ->where('u.username = ?', 'jwage');
    
    $user = $q->fetchOne();

Notice how I only selected the ``id`` and ``username``, but we have
an additional column named ``email_address``. If I were to access
that property it would lazily load the data.

::

    [php]
    echo $user['email_address']

    **NOTE** The above code would result in an additional query to the
    database that would lazy load all unloaded properties of an object
    in proxy state. A record is in proxy state when it has one or more
    properties that have not been loaded from the database.


Be aware
--------

This can be both a curse and a blessing because if you lazily load
many properties and relationships this means you will have a high
query count per page. In Doctrine 1.x lazy loading is on by default
so it is often overly used. The problem is people aren't even aware
that it is happening.

More Examples
-------------

Imagine you had a ``User`` and ``Profile`` model where ``User`` has
one ``Profile`` and ``Profile`` has one ``User``, a simple
one-to-one relationship. If I were to write a DQL query where I
retrieve an individual user record like the following.

::

    [php]
    $q = Doctrine::getTable('User')
      ->createQuery('u')
      ->where('u.username = ?', 'jwage');
    
    $user = $q->fetchOne();

But then I wanted to retrieve the ``Profile`` for that ``User`` I
could do so by simply accessing the ``Profile`` property on
``User``.

::

    [php]
    $profile = $user->Profile;

The above code would result in an additional query to the database
that loads the ``Profile`` record for the ``User`` in question. Now
if I were to be rendering a list of twenty ``User`` objects and I
lazily load the profile of each user that means I would have 21
queries total! That is too many! In that case it would be smart to
``leftJoin()`` the ``Profile`` object like the following.

::

    [php]
    $q = Doctrine::getTable('User')
      ->createQuery('u')
      ->leftJoin('u.Profile p');
    
    $users = $q->execute();

Now when I access the ``Profile`` relationship of an individual
object the data would already be present and no lazy loading would
be required.

Why?
----

I made this blog post because I noticed this feature being abused
and overly used just because it makes things easier. The goal is to
make you aware of what is happening so that you can effectively use
lazy loading and not end up having applications with very high
query counts per page.

I've seen this many times and the blame is often put on Doctrine
but really it is the tool not being used properly. So, be aware of
when you are lazy loading properties and the total number of
queries you execute per page. Make sure you always join required
relationships and only select the properties you need to access. It
doesn't make sense to load data if you're not going to be using
it.

How?
----

If you need help with keeping track of how many queries you have
per page, frameworks like
`Symfony <http://www.symfony-project.org/book/1_0/16-Application-Management-Tools#chapter_16_sub_web_debug_toolbar>`_
and `Zend Framework <http://framework.zend.com>`_ give you debug
tools to show you how many queries you have per page. Or of course
you can always use the
`Profiling <http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/1_1/en/component-overview:profiler>`_
tool built in to Doctrine to log the queries in your application
and keep track of it that way.
